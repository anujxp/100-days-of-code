Day 4: Java Loops & Control Flow üîÅ

Welcome to Day 4 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge! Today's focus was on a fundamental concept in programming: loops. I explored how to teach Java to perform repetitive tasks intelligently, making code more efficient, automated, and powerful.

This directory contains detailed, commented Java files explaining each type of loop and the control statements that manage them.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts Covered

    for Loop: Used for iterations when you know the exact number of repetitions.

    while Loop: Ideal for looping as long as a specific condition is true, especially when the number of iterations is unknown.

    do-while Loop: A variation of the while loop that guarantees the code block is executed at least once.

    break and continue: Control statements to exit a loop prematurely or skip a specific iteration.

    Nested Loops: The concept of running a loop inside another loop, perfect for handling multi-dimensional tasks.

üìÇ File Descriptions

This repository contains the following source code files:

    ForLoopExplained.java

        Description: Demonstrates various uses of the for loop, including counting up, counting down, skipping numbers, and calculating a sum.

    WhileLoopExplained.java

        Description: Implements a fun number guessing game to show how a while loop works when the end point is not known in advance.

    DoWhileLoopExplained.java

        Description: Features a menu-driven program to illustrate the do-while loop, which always executes at least one time.

    BreakAndContinueExplained.java

        Description: A practical example showing how to use break to exit a loop early and continue to skip an iteration, giving you precise control over your loops.

    NestedLoopsExplained.java

        Description: Explains nested loops by generating a 2D coordinate map and a classic multiplication table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile and Run the Code

You can compile and run any of the Java files from your terminal.

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory containing these files.

    Compile the Java file (e.g., ForLoopExplained.java):
    Bash

javac ForLoopExplained.java

Run the compiled code:
Bash

    java ForLoopExplained

    Replace ForLoopExplained with the name of the file you wish to run.

üí≠ Day 4 Reflection

Today was about mastering repetition with intelligence. Loops are the engine of automation in programming. Understanding which loop to use for a given scenario is key to writing clean and optimized code. With break and continue, we gain an even finer level of control, allowing us to handle exceptions and special cases gracefully.
